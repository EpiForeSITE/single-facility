## Code Style Guidelines


## Specific Instructions
Any mention of time in this model is counted in days since the start of the simulation.
Time is represented continuously with a double precision floating point number.  Each
whole number represents a new day.  So, 1.0 is the start of day 1.  1.5 is midday of day 1

Any reports created on the outputs of this model should have descriptive titles that clearly 
indicate what the analysis is about, with "Single-Facility Analysis" as the author field. 
For example:
- title: "Daily Patient Admissions Descriptive Statistics"
- author: "Single-Facility Analysis"
