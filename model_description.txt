Single Facility Disease Transmission Model

This is an agent-based model (ABM) built with Repast Simphony for simulating disease transmission 
in healthcare facilities. The model focuses on Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and 
other healthcare-associated infections.

Key Features:
- Patient admission/discharge with realistic flow patterns
- Disease importation, transmission, colonization, and decolonization
- Active surveillance testing and patient isolation interventions
- Configurable parameters for different facility types and pathogens
- Comprehensive output metrics for epidemiological analysis

For detailed documentation, installation instructions, and usage guide, 
please see the README.md file in the project root directory.
